# nvim-backup
Custom configuration of neovim with packages I want and their keybindings

Side note:
  Patience with Pop_OS, perhaps an update will occur and fix the major problem (busybox/initramfs). Else attempt the recovery/refresh option (reinstall everything later after backing up to storage). 
  Ultimatum: clean install
